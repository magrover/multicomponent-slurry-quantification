Supporting GitHub information for Multicomponent Slurry Monitoring at Hanford

This repository contains the code, spectral data, and concentration data used in “Quantifying Dense Multicomponent Slurries with In-line ATR-FTIR and Raman Spectroscopy: A Hanford case study.”

## Contents:

1. `ATR-FTIR Concentrations.csv` and `Raman Concentrations.csv` contain gravimetric concentration measurements, where each row corresponds to an experiment and each column corresponds to a chemical species. `ATR-FTIR Concentrations.csv` reports molalities for all species, while `Raman Concentrations.csv` reports $g compound / kg water$.
